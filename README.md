# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

# Description
The **Advanced-CSS-Portfolio** project is the second homework assignment of the March 2021 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

Setting up for our future career successes, this project focuses on applying recently learned core skills with advanced CSS. Built for ourselves and potential employers, this project contains a portfolio gallery of my most recent GitHub deployed repositories, a short story about myself, social media links, and contact information.

This project is for an employer to review samples of work and assess my candidacy for an open position.

# Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
